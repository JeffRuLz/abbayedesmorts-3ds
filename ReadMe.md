## History

[Abbaye des Morts](https://www.locomalito.com/abbaye_des_morts.php) is a freeware game
made by LocoMalito (with the help of Gryzor87 for Music and FX) in 2010. It was developed
with Gamemaker and only runs natively in Microsoft Windows systems.

This is a port to GNU/Linux systems and any system that supports C and SDL libraries.

The version 2.0 of the game is a port from SDL1.2 to SDL2 libraries. This includes a nice
set of features: OpenGL rendering, auto-scaling, Android & IOS support, VSync, etc.

This 3DS version is based on version 2.0, but with the SDL2 functions replaced with standard 3DS ones.
